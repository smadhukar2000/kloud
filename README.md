# kloud

Hi,



Dev Environment
------
VS2017, Azure Function Apps, MSUNIT, .NET MOQ etc.


GITHUB Public Repo
https://github.com/smadhukar2000/kloud

I have published live Logical App in Azure, those can be accessed from below URL

End Points
https://functions-khub.azurewebsites.net/api/cars  - API
https://functions-khub.azurewebsites.net/api/brandwithowners - Consuming the api

As of now both Azure functions display output in JSON format only. 


Note:
Solution can be extended by using  jQuery/ AngularJs to represent API output in more user friendly way.
